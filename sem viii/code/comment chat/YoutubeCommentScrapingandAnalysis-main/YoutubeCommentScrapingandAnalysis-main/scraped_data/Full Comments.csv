@Techwithasideofcocoa,This channel is my dream for working solely on an iPad in the future. Keep going!
@AngelOtero,"I have the iPadPro 13"" and a MacBook Pro 14"" and for some strange reason I prefer the iPad a thousand times more than the MacBook Pro. 

I am a consultant in the area of technology, specifically data centers and virtualization and so far all the work I do I can do effectively from my iPad. 

Thank you for the effort to bring relevant content to the professional world beyond the world of content creation that YouTube has accustomed us to. 

The content of your videos is excellent. Keep going forward. Greetings from Puerto Rico"
@mannym7849,"Hi Tech Dad, great video! I have to say that I have had my M4 iPad Pro 13” since my birthday in January. I am loving it! It’s MORE THAN capable of handing all my productivity means that I do with it and I love how portable it is and I love the Magic Keyboard and the Pencil Pro. I don’t regret paying the £1,977.00 for the whole package as it has meant that my dependence on using my Lenovo laptop is getting lesser and lesser."
@calebmccalla9675,I am definitely one of those where my work lets me just use an iPad. I have the iPad Pro M2 and have zero accessories for it. It’s absolutely amazing how much stuff I can use the iPad for. Makes my life so much easier.
@rj-zn3cw,"I’m a software developer and I chose the iPad Pro M4 because of the more flexible and ergonomic form factor and because I wanted a touch device to unleash my creativity. I have had this device since November of 2024 and I don’t miss my MacBook at all. My only gripe is with the keyboards. The iPad Magic Keyboard (not often, but) sometimes fails to register key presses. I hope Apple reads this and rethinks the iPad connector. The Bluetooth Magic Keyboard also can disconnect itself on a rare occasion. This is less than optimal as typos can introduce bugs in my code. Other than that, the iPad Pro has been a solid device and I don’t plan to get a laptop ever again."
@anchoragedj," Just wanted to mention, like you I’ve switched - for nearly a year as well, and bought the OWC ‘Go’ Dock. With TB4 out of the iPad, you’re able to add another 13 I/O ports, including wired 2.5Gb/s Ethernet, USBA (3.2) x 3, two extra, independent Thunderbolt 4 ports in the dock with two ports for the I/O of additional peripherals, including displays. It also adds a standard USB C (3.2), SD slot, and more I’m forgetting, but IMO, the best part is a built in power supply, so NO wall warts! This will allow you to share your display (one of the things I forgot, the dock has HDMI), and two more independent TB4 controllers, literally opening your entire world up for ALL of your gigs! As well as extra external storage for usage and file management how you prefer to handle the way you want to do it. 
I agree, though, with you as far as the different apps and shortcomings, additional control of, or optional choice to turn off (swiping back)… etc. 

I make my mortgage - like you, doing a couple jobs; I run a business, work in broadcasting and my hustle is nightclub live ‘DJ’ing’. I use my m4 5G iPad at all three, for show prep in radio, as well as hosting our weekly meetings (I am a program director, as well as on air afternoon drive), and I have done our budgets on Excel as well as EBIT forecasting, as easily as I’d be able to on a desk/laptop. 

The incessant connectivity is a HUGE plus for me, especially with my business and signing contracts to hosting the event, wedding, party, etc… by using it’s connectivity for music playback, video and recording while live. Not until the M series iPads have I had the confidence in the device as a a primary but I am in a conundrum right now, strongly considering a Studio for the house, as I also do a lot of music production (Logic Pro/Ableton and a bazillion plug ins, that most, happen to be available for the iPad!)

But I’ve yet to be able - rather been unable to achieve what’s been necessary to capture on the iPad and produce the audio or video - as well as send it in the correct formats

The big miss for me is disc utility. While you can now erase drives and a few other tricks in files by long pressing on connected drives -  there’s no first aid, re-partitioning, or ‘fixing’ a corrupt drive. Nor is there an ‘Eject’ button, which makes pulling the dock line or drive from the dock a gamble, and one that corrupted the drive I had to use a Mac to fix.

Great content, excellent subject - and one that when asked, most can’t come up with a real reason why they need macOS vs an iPad. Most are not folding DNA, running billions of lines of code and simulations, or creating macros in Excel! The vast majority are checking messages, emails, writing a document or editing, consuming media, or printing an assignment.  All and soooooo much more that can be done easily on iPad - including the setup of your new printer!

Take care"
@ThatWellnessGuy,"This is a great real world summary of using iPad Pro as a computer. iPadOS has gotten so much better for productivity in recent years, but I've still struggled to make the full transition from a Mac/Macbook to my iPad Pro. As you mentioned, most apps fall short in comparison to their full-fledged MacOS equivalents. And of course, some apps simply don't exist or are just poorly reformatted from the iPhone apps. I wish they'd make a Surface-style MacBook that can be used in tablet or computer mode, making both devices obsolete. We know they could do it if they wanted to."
@kaischmidt730,that onedrive mess—I thought that was because I use a cheapo ipad 9. kinda happy to know that upgrading to an iPad pro wouldn't alleviate that pain.
@Beautybytracilei,"I primarily use an iPad Pro at home, although I just purchased a Mac mini for those times when I really do need a computer. I have a PC laptop that I use for work. I can almost do all of my work on the iPad, but there are some things in Excel that I just can’t do, or that the work around is too time-consuming to mess with on the iPad. Personally, I love the option of using the touchscreen, the keyboard or the pencil on my iPad. The versatility is unmatched in that way. I also much prefer working on an iPad to working on a laptop. The screen is just so much better and I feel that it is more seamless when switching between applications. I’m confident that there will be a day when the apps on the iPad are good enough to make it my only device. Just not today."
@ktt1977,"I have remote access my PC from my iPad Pro 13 if I need more advanced excel or word usage. Works nicely on a good connection. It helps to have cellular iPad, very useful"
@scotdoc,Another great video thanks. Your videos are the best on YouTube on this topic & inspired me to persevere with the move from MacBook to iPad Pro. Loving it so far. I totally agree that you need to give yourself time to relearn how to do some tasks. After a while it’s become as fast to do things as on my MBP. iPad is so much more fun and sooo versatile!  11:47
@BrennanArrold,"Thanks for sharing. I enjoy your videos being done with real world experience 

I've been using the iPad since day dot. I used the early versions for work where I could and this got so much better when Microsoft and Cisco (Webex) developed their apps for the IPad - Others soon followed. 

Other significant improvements have been the introduction of the iPad Pro in 2017, then the Magic Keyboard in 2020 and surprisingly the ""Request Desktop Website"" for setting for Safari. 

I've been using the iPad Pro as my primary device (work and personal) since 2018. Ably supported by my iPhone, iPad Mini and MacBook.  

There are still a few things I need my MacBook for, and it's a comfort to have it available for those occasions. That is less and less these days. "
@JonDisnard,"Nice. I've been doing the same thing with a big Samsung S9 tab ultra. I'm an IT person, software engineer, and an aging student. Microsoft suite is usable, but even the online version is sometimes better than the native Android. All browser stuff is pretty good, and we have several browser options on Android. Google suite is decent. Samsung has a Dex mode to make things very similar to desktop, with floating windows."
@TransitAndTeslas,I am loving that look of having no app icons
@fifthfeliciano2348,"I’m a teacher and I both have an iPad Pro and a Macbook. I can definitely work with my iPad but I keep on coming back to my mac because I print a lot of documents and my printer is not a wifi ready. But workflow wise, I can survive with just an iPad."
@terencealbertmcbain8041,"I am using the 9th gen iPad at this point, but would like to get the iPad Pro m4a enjoy the iPad because of the security, the only thing is the price of $2,600 out of price range right now"
@AlejandroEarthPerson,"You mentioned my 2 reasons I cannot move to or rely solely on the ipadOS… smartsheets is annoying and zoom sharing just not there. 

I’m holiday Apple fix WebKit or other browsers can bring their own engines… and sharing screen. 

You got a new follower just to keep up to date with what’s possible."
@KatanaHYC,I tried really hard to adjust my workload and I finally did it at 95%. Only problems are track changes at big .doc files or managing huge .pdf files.
@24hrstolive27,"new to channel love the content, just bought the 13 in pro with 512gb and loving it.... thank you, i dont need a computer when i have this... so much easier to use"
@ryanduffy5887,"I love my ipad pro, dont need a pro but its nice to have. The one thing id love to see is an apple magic keyboard that could also work as a case maybe that allows the keyboard to detach. My kids are very clumsy and i need a protective case lol"
@dirkackbar2041,"My IMac is old (2013), my iPad Pro is somewhat old (3rd generation). I got a m4 MacBook 14 inch. I still like playin around on my ipad. If it could use full office 365 that would be great."
@moonbaby6134,iPad is 19 is supposed to be a decent jump towards a more Mac way of working.  Be interesting to see what your thoughts are when it comes out in the autumn.
@rorywalters1614,"I can do all my MacBook stuff on my iPad 9, so I can leave my old MacBook Pro 2016 at my work place, and bring the iPad to anywhere else. To anyone who wants to use the iPad as a laptop replacement, I would suggest: Do not trying to do everything the laptop way, what I mean is, don’t try to do everything with a mouse or trackpad. In many situations you can do something much easier with your finger taps. I own both Apple’s Smart Keyboard cover and Logitech’s Combo Touch, and I use the Smart Keyboard the most. I found for the most part, the trackpad on the Combo Touch keyboard is useless, because it slows me down doing tasks, I can do stuff much quicker with finger taps. Using a mouse would be better but still slower than finger taps. You got a touch screen and a touch-optimised interface, take advantage of them."
@MikeComicBook,"This really depends on the work you do. For mathematical modelling, this is really useless. Even writing a mathematically oriented paper causes problems. First, we use LaTeX, a de facto standard for mathematical/technical papers. Second, even if for some reason (e.g., collaboration) we use MS Word, it still does not allow for using mathematical formulae (on the iPad). There are too many limitations to use it comfortably as a computer replacement. However, the iPad is great as a companion device. I usually connect my MacBook Pro to a display or share a screen, say through MS Teams or Zoom, and then AirDrop my iPad’s screen on it, which lets me write any mathematics, game theory, and mathematical economics for my students. This combination is tough to beat. It was interesting to see your points. Well done."
@asfanebi567,glad this setup works for you  keep it up
@mrmartywaring,"For me, the iPad is an amazing device that I like to use as my travel alternative. I can perform about 80-85% of my tasks. There are some things I absulutely need my MacBook or Windows laptop to perform those tasks more efficiently."
@TimeTravelersTales-w5p,Yes - screen on secondary monitor needs to show shared  - important for apple to fix this in new 19
@ReverseSpirits,I’ll be back in 66 days when you use it for a year 
@craigjok,Nicely Done 
@sherrilltechnology,If Apple would make the iPad to use 2 monitors i would completely go to the iPad at work!! I wish they would get that working for reals i can deal with everything else! Great video!
@marlonalvarez9029,"Thanks for the video. I want to make the switch but I have a software that requires a laptop/pc to run, unfortunately."
@ishayb67,"Hi, First of all, thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience.
 I also switched to working full-time on an iPad m4 Pro about eight months ago, Most of my work is in Office with Copilot automatically running in the background (I work with the Unibrist account) and basic things I can't do or don't know how to do, how can I open more than one Word screen?"
@Tech4YourNeeds,"I use my iPad Pro 11-inch with 256GB of storage for about 95% of my usage, while I only use my Windows laptop for the remaining 5%."
@maniojha4389,"Really helpful & awesome video man
Could u plz make a video on how to use mouse & keyboard to actually use my ipad Pro M1 as a MacBook ( do i need a mouse)
Would really appreciate it"
@jimisnow,"Nice videos, thanks- your thoughts on nano-texture for iPad
?"
@mikevigrass,I enjoyed the video! Have you experimented with the chrome browser? Does it render the pages better than what you were experimenting with Safari?
@whitecomet25,Hi so far i used ipad pro as a laptop replacement for 19 days. Its worth than windows. I will the AAA games soon.
@DanielBallJJBBA,How many nicks & scratches do you see on this after such consistent use?
@fernandoscolletion,Achilles heel is still “Finder”.
@LIGHTISBURNING,You cant create Anki cards on an iPad... that is the problem.
@Arthishow,"This cannot do it for me. I dunno how many times I wanted to do something quite simple like open a ppt and it just didn't work and I got this error message ""can't communicate with..."", or maybe sometimes you're in an app and you copy the text or the image and it just doesn't... Or simple things you can always do on desktop like copying an image and passing it in image search will not work on ipad, you need to actually download the image then browse for it to upload it to an image search window... Some very simple things require so much tweaking around. I dunno how many times I've been frustrating trying to do something incredibly simple that desktop had always done simply, and tried maybe 20 work arounds before NOT finding any way to do it on ipad... no browser plugins as well...

Finally, for some apps or workflows, the iPad is by default set to not allow it. I use obsidian app a lot, and most plugins do not work on mobile version. I often edit css snippets on the go but the hidden folder is simply inaccessible on ipad. I do more and more coding but you don't really have root access to ipadOs and there's no proper terminal to work on.."
@ChairmanKimchi,How is your cycle count and battery health looking like?
@georgetinsley3446,But then there is at least 1 app on the iPad that you can’t on Mac which is Bluebeam. Thankfully now they have Bluebeam cloud.
@mesetime,"I tried to use the web-version of M365 on my ipad pro & mac mini, but I really don‘t like it.. How do you guys use M365 apps on Apple devices? The reviews on Mac App-Store are very bad.
I‘m new with Mac, I had Windows before, should I download the mac version from the microsoft website for my mac mini and from the app store for my ipad? 
I just don‘t want to use the web-version anymore, this experience is really painful for an ex-windows-user.."
@zoganje,"Great video, Tech Dad. Just wondering, what kind of degree do you hold? (I'm asking because you've mentioned you cover so many different fields of study)."
@mr_red13,"For traveling and keeping my 14"" MBP at home, would you recommend the 11"" or 13"" for typing on the Magic Keyboard (in iA Writer)?"
@veloxif,"No views in 56 seconds… not a good sign… Solid video, I’ve been experimenting using my iPad for a good chunk of my workflow recently and, aside from the obvious lack of access to dedicated apps, it performs quite well."
@TheMetalMag,"interesting, I don't see myself replacing my desktop computer with an iPad"
@zaharizahariev,"Ipad pro is oxymoron it's a glorified you tube display. It's so dishonest of Apple to lie to it's customer base ...but I guess that's what you get by having an accountant as ceo.
Astronomical profits unhappy customers."
@MarcusWarcus40,The vibe in these comments is not it. iPads are awesome
@PLANETWATERMELON,"I get that you had adapted to using the iPad, but with all the work around I still think you would have done better with a Macbook Air and it would have been less expensive.  In fact you would have had enough left after to get an iPad Air for tablet things."
@cyberartsy,"Dude! Have you heard? We lost one of the biggest “iPad as a laptop” evangelist on YT, Christopher Lawley. When I questioned him, he said: “I’ve grown as a person”.  No, dude. You ran out of video ideas. lol If you do this shit to us, I’ll know for a fact you are here for the views like the rest of them! "
@chocolate_squiggle,"You couldn't PAY me to only use ANY tablet, neither Android nor Apple. The fricken hoops you have to jump through just to do the most basic things, like see a file extension, or see how large a file is. BASIC file management functions. There's not even a bloody text editor installed by default on my Android phones...Apple may be superior in that regard I don't know, but I really struggle just as badly whenever my sister asks me to 'fix her ipad'."
@znkdev,"it's a Nah, thanks haha"
@dudiyamin3311,Just use Mac ️
@m4tru88,"iPad can't even be a reliable word processing machine since it can't even do a basic function like Ctrl + Backspace, let alone replacing a desktop/laptop computer."
@multimagical3137,is impossible for a normal peoples
@sotonin,"How to tell me you have no clue without telling me you have no clue. Ipads are not computers, get real."
